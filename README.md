# language-bot-test
How to use bot: 
There are 2 functionalities of this bot: add/remove roles + load resources for language classes
(Note all commands are space sensitive but NOT case sensitive)
Class Name: Beginners, Intermediate, Advanced, English

Add/Remove roles:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How to add a role: !add <Class Name>  (i.e. !add Beginners, !add Intermediate etc.) 
- How to remove your role: !remove <Class Name> (i.e. !remove English, !remove Advanced etc.) 

Load class resources for language classes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of posting it on Discord just like on the Language Class FB group, you can type a command to load the ppt slides of any week as you desire. Links will be updated right after I posted on FB group.

How to load resources of any week: !Week <week number> <Class Name> 
(For Example:
 - !Week 1 Beginners loads resources from the first lesson of beginners class 
 - !Week 5 Advanced loads resources from the 5th class of the advanced class)

For Spring 2022:
- Week 1 = 1st Lesson (Week 3)
- Week 2 = 2nd Lesson (Week 4)
- Week 3 = 3rd Lesson (Week 5)
- Week 4 = 4th Lesson (Week 6)
- Week 5 = 5th Lesson (Week 7)
- Week 6 = 6th Lesson (Week 8 for Eng + Adv, Week 9 for Int + Beg)
- Week 7 = 7th Lesson (Week 9 for Eng + Adv, Week 10 for Int + Beg)
- Week 8 = 8th Lesson (Week 10 for Eng + Adv, Week 9 for Int + Beg)
- Week 9 = 9th/last lesson (Week 11 for Eng + Adv, Week 12 for Int + Beg)
